# Autofill

This repository contains a minimal browser extension that detects and logs
form fields inside HTML tables on the current page. It can be used as a
starting point for auto‐filling or analysis tools.

## Using the extension
1. Open Chrome or any Chromium‐based browser and navigate to
   `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this repository directory.
4. Visit any webpage and open the browser console. The extension will print
a list of table fields (inputs, textareas or selects) found on that page.
